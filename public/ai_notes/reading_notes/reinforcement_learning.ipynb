    "One of the key takeaways from this chapter was the distinction between the value function and rewards function in an RL problem. The value function is ultimately what we are optimizing for, as this is the total cumulative reward, or rather the reward associated with solving the problem at the highest level. The reward function, but contrast, evaluates awards state by state, and can be thought of as the short-term payoff for entering any given state. I like this distinction, because it opens up the idea of scoping the problem, and ensuring you are indeed building a system that achieves what you set out to achieve. That sounds straightforward enough, but given the nuances of building a policy to reinforce even the simplest of goals, the balance of these functions will undoubtedly become a focus of my work. These are the functions we are learning as we build our RL policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a treatment of the agent and the environment, as well as a policy and model of the environment. The agent learns while interacting with the environment, which the authors point out is different from evolutionary methods. I'm curious about this distinction, as it is pointed out that genetic algorithms (and perhaps swarm algorithms?) can be used to solve RL problems. I'm putting a map together of how these various approaches relate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between greedy and exploratory moves, and this will come up again in our examination of explore/exploit tradeoffs. This touches upon the balance of reward vs. value function optimization, and also the broader leverage of stochastic process in search problems. The term temporal-difference learning is used, which doesn't seem like much at first blush, but relates in my mind to calculus (derivative, gradient, etc.) - measuring a rate of change between two times (states in these problems)."

    "n-armed bandit problems are introduced, where the choice to exploit prior knowledge of known advantageous probabilities is pitted against the choice of probabilities that could be advantageous, yet whose probabilities are unknown or more variable. This uncertainty is important. One of the choices with greater variability could in fact be better than the greedy choice in the long-term. How would we make this choice? I'm reminded of simulated annealing. Perhaps policies that take on my risk early on, and then play more conservatively later on?\n",

In this model, preference probabilities are increased by an increment calculated from the difference of the observed reward and the reference reward (often the average of previously received rewards). \n",

With GPI with interleave policy evaluation with policy improvement, which is a common approach for solving RL problems.

And then we iterate. \n",

For policy iteration, we use the current policy to find a better policy using V_current_policy, and then calculate V on the new policy to yield a better policy (oh how I wish Squarespace rendered Latex. I know, I know, time to actually build out a better blog). One issue with this approach is that convergence only happens in the limit. \n",

All possible next steps are backed-up, not just a sample, which is what makes it a full backup. \n",

I found it useful to distinguish on-line learning from simulated learning, as this sets the stage for our building. On-line learning requires no prior knowledge of the environment, while simulated learning requires a model to generate sample transitions. Rather than use a model to compute the value of each state, they simply average many returns that start in that state. \n",

Whereas Monte Carlo must wait to the end of the episode to determine the V value (as that is when reward is calculated), TD can make this update in the next time step, using the observed reward and V estimate at t+1. TD updates are sample backups, as they are referencing the value of a successive state to compute a backed-up value, and then using it to change the value of the original state. This differs from the full backups of DP, where we take into account the complete distribution for all possible successors. \n",
