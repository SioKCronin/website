      <description>To paraphrase Dr. Rick Sloot&amp;rsquo;s address at the ceremonial opening of University of Amsterdam&amp;rsquo;s Institute for Advanced Systems - if you put together a philosopher and a theoretical physicist together and ask them to &amp;ldquo;make something&amp;rdquo;, they may not know where to begin.
That&amp;rsquo;s where complexity science comes in.
This burgeoning research arena, wearing hand-me-downs from theoretical physics and math (probability, graph theory), has been delightfully uprooting classical theory in economics, neuroscience, and biology (amongst other disciplines) for over a decade, calling all scientists to take a deeper look into how network science might apply to their field.</description>

      <description>1: Motivation + Overview + Exact Solution Method VIDEO
(0 - 10) Starts off with a review of MDPs from Barto, and then sets up a simple grid world with an example of a deterministic policy with infinite horizon.
(10-20) OMG, talk gets a bit derailed by series of rando questions that don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be clarifying thinking (answerable by the definition of a deterministic policy). Maybe too much coffee?</description>

      <description>John Shulman Deep RL I found these talks to be super straightforward and helpful. A breath of fresh air.
Part 1 A brief overview of applications, including robotics, inventory management, resource allocation (queuing), and routing problems (sequential decision making problem).
Differentiating between policy optimization and dynamic programming. In particular, policy optimization including DFO/Evolutionary algorithms (derivative-free) and Policy Gradients (using gradients, improves with more parameters. Dynamic programming requires discrete finite states, and so must be approximated (for instance, approximating function with neural nets).</description>
