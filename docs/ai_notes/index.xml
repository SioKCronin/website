      <description>A Thousand Plateaus by Gilles Deleuze &amp;amp; Felix Guattari
&amp;ldquo;The question is not: is it true? But: does it work? What new thoughts does it make possible to think? What new emotion does it make possible to feel? What new sensations and perceptions does it open in the body?&amp;rdquo; Brian Massumi, translator.
There is no way to &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; this book, any more than there is a way to review the experience of witnessing sunlight over the course of one&amp;rsquo;s life.</description>

      <title>Binet&#39;s Formula</title>

      <description>This proof was shared with me by my friend Chuck Larrieu Casias, and I liked it so much I wanted to write it up here.
Suppose we have two similar rectangles, $A$ and $B$. Let $A$ have sides $a$ and $b$, and $B$ have corresponding sides $b$ and $a+b$.
Then $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{a+b}{b}$. Also, $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} + 1$.
Call $\phi = \frac{b}{a}$. Then $\phi = \frac{1}{\phi} + 1$.
Multiply both sides by $\phi$ to get $\phi^2 = \phi + 1$.</description>

      <description>Oh my, this book is every bit as delightful as I had imagined it would be.
To be clear, I had slated this book as my &amp;ldquo;summer&amp;rdquo; read, imagining I would have stolen myself to an island somewhere to curl up alongside this book. But life found me in a data engineering fellowship in Palo Alto instead, drinking an endless stream of La Croix (La Croixes?) whilst building streaming pipelines and occassionaly drawing inspiration from the large bronze statue of Nikola Tesla that stood outside the office.</description>

      <title>Intersection of Convex Sets</title>

      <description>Convex sets are interesting in the context of optimization, as they represent regions where we know we can find global minima. A convex region is a region where for every pair of points within the region, every point on the line that joins the points is also within the region.
Fun fact - the intersection of all convex sets containing a given subset A of Euclidean space, is called the convex hull of A, which is the smallest convex set containing A.</description>

      <title>Parrallelogram is convex</title>

      <description>Let $S$ be the parallelogram consisting of all linear combinations of $t_{1}v_{1} + t_{2}v_{2}$ with $0 \leq t_{1} \leq $ and $0 \leq t_{2} \leq $, or equivlently $0 \leq t_{i} \leq $.
We remember that the line segment $PQ$ consists of all points $(1-t)P + tQ$ with $0\leq t \leq 1$, and that $PQ$ exists in vector space $S$ if all points $P, Q$ exist in $S$.
Proof. Let $P=t_{1}v_{1} + t_{2}v_{2}$ and $Q=t_{1}v_{1} + t_{2}v_{2}$ be points in $S$.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Perception</title>

      <description>Phenomenology of Perception by Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
Originally printed in 1945 by Editions Gallimard, with English translation published in 1958 by Routledge &amp;amp; Kegan Paul. I am referencing the 2002 Routledge Classics edition.
Overview There are times in our lives when we notice the apparatus of our perception. Maybe we see a mirage emerge on the horizon, or grow determined to know why our ears are ringing. When we study such visual apparitions and sonic glitches, we align ourselves with generations of philosophers and cognitive scientists who have looked at perception&amp;rsquo;s outliers to help us understand what happens all along without our noticing.</description>

      <title>Reactive Microservices Architecture</title>

      <description>When my dog Arlo was a puppy, he went through a period where being on a leash made him anxious, and he would react more agressively to other dogs on the street. My husband and I took him to a class at the local SPCA called &amp;ldquo;Reactive Rover&amp;rdquo; where he learned to chill out whilst walking on leash. In the context of this class, reactive was deemed a negative quality we were learning to un-condition, yet, in service architecture, reactive takes on an entirely different meaning.</description>

      <description>Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (1998). Richard Sutton &amp;amp; Andrew Barto. At the onset, I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know how much has changed since this book&amp;rsquo;s publication 20 years ago. That being said, as these are two leaders in the field, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in gaining a sense of their perspective on the history/origin of this subfield, and acclimating to some of the core concepts/constructs. CHAPTER 1 One of the key takeaways from this chapter was the distinction between the value function and rewards function in an RL problem.</description>

      <description>Space-Time Continuous Models of Swarm Robotic Systems: Supporting Global-to-Local Programming, by Heiko Hamann
Fundamentals of Swarm Robotics Multi-robot systems have the ability to show complex behavior, which is one of the features that motivate my study of them. They also have the potential to solve classic problems in novel, distributed ways. What I&amp;rsquo;m excited about in this book is the presentation of how we derive partial differential equations (Fokker-Planck equation) from a stochastic differential equation (Langevin equation), which forms the basis of the Brownian motion model.</description>

      <title>Square Root of 2 is Irrational</title>
      <link>https://siobhankcronin.com/ai_notes/proofs/proove_sqrt2_is_irrational/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://siobhankcronin.com/ai_notes/proofs/proove_sqrt2_is_irrational/</guid>
      <description>Proof. Assume for contradiction that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.
Therefore, there exists $p, q$ such that $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $q \neq 0$, and $p, q$ share no common divisors other than 1.
Squaring both sides gives $2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$, so consequently $2q^2 = p^2$.
If a square of a number is even, then the number is even, so there exists some number $k$ such that $p=2k$. Subsituting this value into the equation yields $2q^2 = 4k^2$, or $q^2 = 2k^2$.</description>
