      <description>I hesitated before putting this note on Correlation in my ML section, but then I remembered this comic:
Also, who could forget this chestnut of a motivational lead in to the topic of Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC)?:
I&amp;rsquo;d like to overview Pearson&amp;rsquo;s r, touch upon Kendall and Spearman, and then dive into MIC.
Pearon&amp;rsquo;s r This is what people typically think of when they think of correlation. It measures the linear relationship between two variables.</description>

      <title>RL in Process Scheduling</title>

      <description>When I mentioned my interest in this idea to my partner Carl, he encouraged me to pursue it, but highlighted that it may be at least a masters thesis to secure the necessary OS and RL foundations to implement something that works. I like multi-year challenges, so wanted to at least start scoping the problem to see what is required.
At the onset, I think it would be helpful to identify how processes are currently scheduled (the dominant paradigms), how process scheduling could be framed as a MDP, and how RL could be applied.</description>
