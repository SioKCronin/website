      <description>When I mentioned my interest in this idea to my partner Carl, he encouraged me to pursue it, but highlighted that it may be at least a masters thesis to secure the necessary OS and RL foundations to implement something that works. I like multi-year challenges, so wanted to at least start scoping the problem to see what is required.
At the onset, I think it would be helpful to identify how processes are currently scheduled (the dominant paradigms), how process scheduling could be framed as a MDP, and how RL could be applied.</description>
