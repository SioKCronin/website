## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

RNNs are networks with loops so that information can persist. 

## Long Short-Term Memory

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a specific type of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies. 

Key steps are a *forget gate layer* and *input gate layer*. 


```python
