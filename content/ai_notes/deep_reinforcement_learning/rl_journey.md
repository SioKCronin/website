# My Deep Reinformcent Learning Journey

## Overview

I'm embarking on a journey to discover novel applications of RL in industry.
I'm secretly very interested in robotic management systems, and hope in time
to work with industrial robots in the wild (um, is it still a
secret if I just told you that?).

The journey begins with these deliverables:
* approachable overviews (with illustrations) of RL foundations
* RL training environments
* implementations of leading RL methods
* implementation of a specific industry application (inventory management)

## Foundations

### Intro to Inventory Control Theory
### Intro to Deep RL
### RL History
### RL in Supply Chain and Inventory Management
### LSTM Networks

## RL training environments

### Unity ML Agents
### OpenAI Gym Agents
### OctoHand (novel cephalapod-inspired environment)

## RL methods

### DQN
### DDPG
### PPO
### HER
### HER-PPO
