Some terms:

* **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**: Most common is URL, but also Uniform Resource Name (URN). 
* **Representational State Transfer (REST)ful API**: Access and manipulate textual
representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless
operations. Payload will be formatted in HTML, Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JSON. 
* **Single Object Access Protocol (SOAP)**: Uses XML. Message negotiation and transmission by
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
