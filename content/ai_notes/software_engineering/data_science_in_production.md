Some of the pain points of conducting research are so ubiquitous
that we scarcely register them. For instance, for years I have found
myself writing parameters and trials specs in a lab book. Straight up
pencil and paper. So when a collaborator asks what I ran last batch,
I'm flipping through my notes. Uh...this is something we already have a 
solve for. Version control.
