I first caught wind of Active Matter through the work of one of my
favorite researchers, Tamas Vicsek, whose intellectual bling includes a
fractal bearing his name.

My understanding of this sprawling sub-domain of physics is that we can
study the activity of individuals agents and systems as though studying
something like hydrodynamics, kinematics, and non-equilbrium statistical
phsyics. Crowds become streams. Flocks become rivers. Networks of agents
become oceans. 


It is this vision of Active Matter that I'll be discussing in this post, and on my site in general, but make not
mistake of it, this field is awesome and sprawling, and worthy of a  more extensive
tour than I will ever be able to give.

## Collective Motion

How governs the shape of a moving crowd leaving a moving theater? We
know there's not a central choreographer, and I don't think we'd go so
far as to say we have a genetic predisposition to filing out of a
theater, so why is it we can identify patterns in crowd dynamics?
