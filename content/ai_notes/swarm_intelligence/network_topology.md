What are the advantages of various topogical structures? How can they be
combined? Mutate over time? How do swarm systems develop communication
topologies?

First, let's get acclimated with the different structures - their
definitions and some useful examples of their use in practice.

### Mesh

Think of a fully connected neural network. If every node in a layer were
also connected to one another, this would be a mesh topology. What we
have instead is a collection of star topologies, wich each node of an
input layer connected to all nodes of the output layer. 

### Star



### Ring


### Hierarchical

This structure will feel familiar to what we explore in object orientd
programming. Inheritance of information (or class methods, etc.) comes
from a defined parent. 

### Bus

While not necessarily our most efficient, perhaps we can think of the
redundancy as being an asset.
