Thinking in Systems by Donella H. Meadows

### Why Systems Work So Well

I jumped to this chapter, because I want to know! Well...why do they?!

Three characteristics of highly functionling systems are explored: resilience,
self-organization, and hierarchy. The last two seem to be in some form of
conflict to me, but I think it is because I implicitly associate self-organization
with non-hierarchical structures (which I'm realizing is not necessary - as
systems can self-organize to a functionaly hierachy, or process of hierarchy-ing).

#### Resilience

We know that resilience is the bounce back from a system that has been stressed
beyond its equilibrium, but what are the mechanisms that make this possible?
Why are some systems resilient and others not? "Resilience arises from a rich
structure of many feedback loops that can work in different ways to restore
a system even after a large pertubation". It's worth noting that, "systems that
are constant over time can be unresilient". 

And this was one of my favorite images:

"I think of resilience as a plateau upon which the system can play, performing
its normal functions in safety. A resilient system has a big plateau, a lot of
space over which it can wander, with gentle, elastic walls that will bounce it
back, if it comes near a dangerous edge. As a system loses its resilience,
its plateau shrinks and its protective walls become lower and more rigid, until
the system is operating on a knife-edge, likely to fall off in one direction
or another whenever it makes a move."

#### Self-Organization

"The capacity of a system to make its own structure more complex is called
self-organization". This resonates deeply with me. I look around the practice
of my life and notice all the attempts to make my life more rich and filled
with life. I sit in our cabin at home, a space we carved out as a sanctuary
within the broader sanctuary of our home. Why does someone need a sanctuary
within a sanctuary? Because I have returned from a war of the soul, and am
learning to feel love, express love, and learn about the world beyond fear. 
The cabin is filled with books about inner and outer worlds. I layer systems
of meaning the way we layer acids in a delicious meal (with aged vinegars
splashing into lemon juice and pickles).
