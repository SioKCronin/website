A Thousand Plateaus by Gilles Deleuze & Felix Guattari

"The question is not: is it true? But: does it work? What new thoughts does
it make possible to think? What new emotion does it make possible to feel?
What new sensations and perceptions does it open in the body?" Brian Massumi,
translator.

There is no way to "review" this book, any more than there is a way to review
the experience of witnessing light over the course of one's light. And yet,
how quickly this book taught me to see just how much work I have still to do
in slipping out of my internalization of the State. My replication of sanctioned
mind, reinforced through public institutions of all shapes and sizes, including
vanguarded traditions of psychology and philosophy. Have you seen this in your
own mind? How we perform thought control in the very act of choosing what books
are worthy of reading? Even down to the fidelity of reading them in the order
they were "intended"?

Recently, while reading a new book of poems by Eileen Myles (I must be living
twice), I realized that I am less faithful to linearity when reading poetry.
My peripheral vision speaks up, and I allow words to enter my awarness in less
predictable patterns. I play with the patterning of seeing, of reading, of
circling back. I let myself linger more; closing the book to give my my memories
a chance to surface and a chance for my conscious mind to scan my thicket of
endlessly chattering body sensations. I let myself do this with poetry, but then,
it seems, I turn that practice off. This is fine in its ways. A recipe asks 
to be read in order, so the pie comes out ... edible. But, how might I explore
more playfullness in my approach to receiving new points of ideation departure
as I engage with the artifacts of other minds? Isn't that why I read books 
in the first place? To gather seeds?

The partnership that is Deleuze & Guittari is itself worthy of rumination.
A philosopher and a psychiatrist who build works/worlds between themselves
and invite us in to co-explore. For years I would end my calls with 
writer/artist Deborah Black with the nagging feeling that we should have recorded
and transcribed our dialogues. That a third self was emerging between us. And
I seem to be gathering more and more evidence to support such emergence is
the catalyst for a new understanding of systems. Not just in one discipline,
say, network science. But across the board. A recognition that system effects
emerge everwhere, especially in the dealings between complex organisms like 
humans. What I mean is, you don't have to wait to look at weather patterns 
and traffic to question "what are the nodes and what are the edges?". This 
can happen in any direction at any time. A zen science. Although perhaps a bit
more greedy than true Zazen, as our science presses for moments of stabilized
knowledge and surfacing of hypotheses to test. We play with desire long enough
to feel some propulsion, knowing in some part of ourselves it is a temporary
folly. A belief in fixed nature long enough to see new ways to break it. 
The song of the rhizome, and what delicious structured/unstructured cacophony.

I keep coming back to this idea of decentralization healing. The need for the 
mind to unlearn localisation. Self at the center. Self against other(s). Our
incessent tree thinking. Self as root. Memory as root. Desire as root. When shall
we release our swarm of curves, tori, circles? How to do so without rupturing
the necessary tools of mind-making? What ARE the necessary tools of mind-making?
This book provides medicine, but how much does one take? Why do we allow academics
to binge at will, while the average businesswoman has scarely heard of such 
lenses of self-understanding/self-making/self-unravelling?
