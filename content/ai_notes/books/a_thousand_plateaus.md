A Thousand Plateaus by Gilles Deleuze & Felix Guattari

"The question is not: is it true? But: does it work? What new thoughts does
it make possible to think? What new emotion does it make possible to feel?
What new sensations and perceptions does it open in the body?" Brian Massumi,
translator.

There is no way to "review" this book, any more than there is a way to review
the experience of witnessing sunlight over the course of one's life. But there
are clearly themes. For instance, the speed with which this book taught me just
how much how much work I still have to do
in slipping out of my internalization of the State. My habitual duty to sanctioned
mind, reinforced by my participation in/with public institutions of all shapes 
and sizes, including the vanguarded traditions of psychology and philosophy. 
Have you glimpzed the ways you have performed the supression of your thoughts in 
the very act of "deciding" what books are worthy of reading? Or the pathways of
thought you've cut off by reading chatpers in the order they were "intended"? 
I have, and am appalled. Such is the impact of this book. It lays bare thoughts 
long mulled over in the private inner sanctums of my mind. It foregrounds 
assumptions long forgotten. It makes evident our patterns of meaning making.

Recently, while reading a book of poems by Eileen Myles (I Must be Living
Twice), I realized that I am far less faithful to linearity when reading poetry.
My peripheral vision speaks up. Words enter my awarness in less
predictable patterns. I allow myself to play with this patterning of 
seeing, of reading, of circling back. I let myself linger; closing the book to 
give memories a chance to surface and my conscious mind a chance to scan body 
sensations. I do this with poetry, yet less so with
prose, and even less so with anything I deem to be a "empirical research", which,
sadly, often extends to all science papers (yet not math; thank goodness I remember
the poetry of math). How might we develop practives of receiving new points of
ideation as points of departure when we engage with the artifacts of other minds? 
Isn't that why we read books in the first place? To gather seeds? Do we assume 
we should only receive the seeds that have been carefully layed out for us, or do we,
as with poetic readings, assume the pantry of documented thought is ours to 
plunder at will?

The partnership that is Deleuze & Guittari is itself worthy of rumination.
A philosopher and a psychiatrist building works/worlds between themselves
and inviting us to join their deprioritization of self in service of discovery. 
I'm reminded of my own explorations with co-discovery.
For years I would end my calls with writer/artist Deborah Black with the nagging 
feeling that we should record and transcrib our dialogues. We knew
there was something other than our individual parts. A third "self" emerging between 
us. And it seems I have been gathering more and more evidence to support that the
study of such emergence lies at the center of the catalyst that will break the
fever dream, at last, that has been dominated this prolonged era of reductionism.
A break that will pave the way for all our unknowable forms of system
thinking/making/researching. 

This is not simply the province of network science. 
System effects emerge everwhere, especially in the dealings 
between complex organisms like humans. Weather
and traffic patterns are not the only places to question "what are the nodes and 
what are the edges?". Complexity modeling can happen in any direction at any time. 
A zen science. Although perhaps a bit more greedy than true Zazen, as we are 
thristy for moments of stabilized meanings and the surfacing of hypotheses to test. 
We play with desire long enough to feel a sense of propulsion, yet know in some 
part of ourselves that it is a temporary folly. We believe in fixed 
nature long enough to see new ways to break it. The song of the rhizome, which
Deleuze & Guitarri so clearly have learned to sing. What delicious 
structured/unstructured cacophonies this song stirs. 

As I read this book I observe a need for decentralization. A need for minds to 
unlearn habitual localisation. Self at the center. Self against other(s). Incessent tree 
thinking. Self as root. Memory as root. Desire as root. Are we ready to release 
our tidy thoughts a swarm of tori and rhizomatic proliferation? Can we do so 
without rupturing the necessary tools of mind-making? What ARE the necessary tools 
of mind-making? This book provides medicine, but what is the right dose? Why 
do we allow academics to binge on such medicine, while the average businesswoman 
scarecely hears of such lenses of self-understanding/self-making/self-unravelling? 
Deleuze & Guittari are never mentioned in The Economist or the New Yorker. Where do we begin
to broaden the participation in this conversation that has been roiling in academia
for decades?
