A Thousand Plateaus by Gilles Deleuze & Felix Guattari

"The question is not: is it true? But: does it work? What new thoughts does
it make possible to think? What new emotion does it make possible to feel?
What new sensations and perceptions does it open in the body?" Brian Massumi,
translator.

There is no way to "review" this book, any more than there is a way to review
the experience of witnessing sunlight over the course of one's life. But there
are clearly themes. For instance, how quickly 
this book taught me to see how much work I have still to do
in slipping out of my internalization of the State. My habitual duty to sanctioned
mind, reinforced by my participation in/with public institutions of all shapes 
and sizes, including vanguarded traditions of psychology and philosophy. 
Have you seen this in your own mind? How you have performed thought control in 
the very act of "deciding" what books are worthy of reading? How you've clung to 
reading books in the order they were "intended"? I have, and am appalled. Such 
is the impact of this book. Laying bare thoughts I have mulled over in private
in the backrooms of my mind. Foregrounding assumptions I forgot to revisit. 

Recently, while reading a book of poems by Eileen Myles (I Must be Living
Twice), I realized that I am less faithful to linearity when reading poetry.
My peripheral vision speaks up. I allow words to enter my awarness in less
predictable patterns. I play with this patterning of seeing, of reading, of
circling back. I let myself linger; closing the book to give my memories
a chance to surface and my conscious mind a chance to scan the thicket of
endlessly chattering body sensations. I do this with poetry, yet less so with
prose, and even less so with anything I deem to be a "technical document", which,
sadly, often extends to all science papers (but not math; thank goodness I remember
the poetry of math). How might we develop practives of receiving new points of
ideation departure as we engage with the artifacts of other minds? Isn't that 
why we read books in the first place? To gather seeds? Do we assume we should
only receive the seeds that have been carefully layed out for us, or do we,
as with poetic readings, assume the pantry of documented thinking is ours to 
plunder at will?

The partnership that is Deleuze & Guittari is itself worthy of rumination.
A philosopher and a psychiatrist building works/worlds between themselves
and inviting us in to explore. I'm reminded of my own explorations with others.
For years I would end my calls with writer/artist Deborah Black with the nagging 
feeling that we should have recorded and transcribed our dialogues. We new
there was something other than our individual parts. A third self emerging between 
us. And it seems I have been gathering more and more evidence to support that the
study of such emergence lies at the center of the the catalyst that will break 
us from the plague of reductionism and pave the way for new forms of system
thinking/making/researching in myriad disciplines. 

This is not simply the province of network science. 
System effects emerge everwhere, especially in the dealings 
between complex organisms like humans. Complex systems of the weather pattern 
and traffic ilk are not the only places to question "what are the nodes and 
what are the edges?". How she felt about how her cupcakes were received by 
her colleagues. How the light illuminated the Seargant painting at the Gardener
Museum that day I felt I had lost all mooring, and found a life raft in art. 
Complexity modeling can happen in any direction at any time. A zen science. 
Although perhaps a bit more greedy than true Zazen, as we are thristy for for 
moments of stabilized knowledge and the surfacing of hypotheses to test. 
We play with desire long enough to feel a sense of propulsion, knowing in some 
part of ourselves that it is a temporary folly. We can learn to believe in fixed 
nature long enough to see new ways to break it. The song of the rhizome, which
Deleuze & Guitarri have clearly learned to sing. What delicious 
structured/unstructured cacophonies this song stirs.

I observe a need for decentralization. A need for minds to unlearn 
habitual localisation. Self at the center. Self against other(s). Incessent tree 
thinking. Self as root. Memory as root. Desire as root. Are we ready to release 
our swarm of curves, tori, and circles? Can we do so without rupturing
the necessary tools of mind-making? What ARE the necessary tools of mind-making?
This book provides medicine, but what is the right dose? Why do we allow academics
to binge on such medicine, while the average businesswoman scarecely hears of such 
lenses of self-understanding/self-making/self-unravelling? Deleuze & Guittari 
are never mentioned in The Economist or the New Yorker. Where do we begin
to broaden the participation in this conversation that has been roiling in academia
for decades?
