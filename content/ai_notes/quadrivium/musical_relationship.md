A bit more about what is happening sonically, and how that affects the body. 
I was always interested in this connection. When I was an undergraduate I studied
music and psychology because I wanted to know what music worked. Why does it move us?
What is happening in us when we listening to stirring music? The answers were always 
fuzzy, shrouded in some hand-wavey aesthetic tradition framing or developmental 
enculturation. But the truth was that the music faculty didn't know, and the psychology
seemed to gloss over phenomena that couldn't be easily pinned down (the music experience
is notoriously squirmy).
