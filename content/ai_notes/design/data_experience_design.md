What signals should we attend to when studying a system? If we capture everything,
how will we filter out the noise to listen to what matters? How do we know what
matters? Does that change over time? How will we engage with what matters? Will 
it be on single metric? A two-dimensional chart? A 3D display? A 3D display that 
moves with color and sound adding further dimensional context?

These are the questions I think throughout my days with, until now, little 
context for exploring their histories and futures in the broader scope of
analytics, interaction design, human computer interaction, and feminist computing.
And yet, I became a data engineer precisely to explore such questions. For me,
the big data revolution extends far beyond how Fortune 500 companies can track
consumer behavior to create "stickier" products. No shade, but I believe
humans are capable of exploring more humanity along the axes of care, trust,
collaboration, healing, joy, service, and contentement than along the axis of
consumption. I'll leave politics out of the equation, and present more of my thesis.

For my piece, I have situated myself between three spheres of overlapping labor, 
which I name loosely as **engineering**, **analytics**, and **data experience design**. 
I engage in this labor in service of the questions above, and in response to the 
imperitive that compels them - people make important decisions that impact myriad 
beings without adequate information, and/or with adequate information that is 
poorly interpretted. Rather than bemoan human ignorance, and throw my 
hands up to the sky, I'm putting my hands (and entire mind-body) to work on
developing new possiblities for leveraging the kinetic-perceptive-cognitive
abilities that are core to our species in novel ways to draw more meaning from 
the data we generate and engage with. In the AI parlance, I'm concerned with 
human in the loop systems, but I have a particular slant on how humans might 
best participate in the loop. 

To kick things, off I thought it best to start with a collection of images
demonstrating how humans have externalized their representations of complex systems,
and to begin to trace the intuitions these systems have given rise to.
