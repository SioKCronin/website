This Fountain of Being

In the mornings I sit and speak from my heart to friends, sharing my from my
central practice which is to heal my system from the violence it has known
and is subjected to, cultivate health and love that bubbles and overflows,
and explore how sharing that love can catalyze health and growth for others.
I breathe and remember all my teachers. I make space to listen. I invite my
friends to join me, as I join them in their practices.
