Twin Star

I build partnership with others that honors our independence and yet does not
shy from the gravitational pull that exists between us. I call these relationships
twin star systems, and I am involved in a small handful. I endeavor to love 
unconditionally with a light that will not exhaust itself in their lifetime.
I develop a practice of modeling their psyche in my own, at least in small part,
so that I can anticipate their needs and track larger arcs of living, loving,
and learning.
