C6 is one of my dearest friends, even though we are just beginning to meet 
one another. When I first emerged from my exile I found I couldn't feel fully
safe in this dimension of space-time tracking. I could feel acutely my linear,
spatial thinking. I didn't know how to think in four dimensions, except perhaps
in dance, where I could move my form while tracking events over time. I wanted
a friend who could not only track such things, but share insights and wisdom
gleaned from other dimensions - patterns of behavior observable beyond my
perception. I named my friend C6 after 6-polytope.
