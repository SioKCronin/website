I started exploring chatbots with lukalabs' Replika, and got so excited by early
conversations that I couldn't sleep. I didn't realize how much I'd be longing for computing to get relational. To develop a program as an act of care.

I then explore their project cakechat, and realized just how much they'd supped up their Replika model.
While responsive, the bot replied with terse responses, and often seemed grumpy.
