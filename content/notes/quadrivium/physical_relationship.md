When I first began training at the Merce Cunningham Studio in 2005, Merce was immersed
in the development of a new software project called Dance Forms that he was developing
and testing in collaboration with the core members of his company and [Credo Interactive](http://charactermotion.com/products/danceforms/). I distinctly remember one day when he was giving a demonstration
to a handful of funders. Jonah Boakaer was by his size, helping him with the interface,
and Cedric Andrieux was standing in the middle of the floor, replicating the movements 
that were displayed on a small screen. At one moment there was a glitch, and what 
would have been a jete was rendered as a figure frozen in mid air. Cedric attempted it,
trying his best to achive the impossible, and everyone laughed. But then Merce paused
and said, "maybe that's interesting as well. To choreograph impossibility". 

The world's movement art traditions are filled with practices for expanding one's
awareness of somatic sensation, planning and executing complex sequences
of thoughts and actions, and creatively navigating space and time in the context 
of a dynamically evolving world filled with agents, materials and systems. And yet,
in my journey as a scientist who "ran away with the [dance] circus" for many years before
returning to science, I have seen rich lineages of advanced embodied cognition fail 
to survive the journey from embodied research to other disciplines. I know many scholars
who are deftly working to amend this, and, while I'm not a scholar, I hope to play my part
as an engineer with a long history of embodied practice. 

First off, here's an inventory of the traditions I have been steeped in.
