I have a book on my nightstand by Paul Lockhardt titled  *Measurement*. It's a 
gentley-paced, meditative journey into the world of building a mathematical imagination.
I have been pondering a sister book to it called *Relationship*, taking a quadrivium
approach to exploring the with-ness that exists between elements, phenomena, experiences.
