"Space, the final frontier". Growing up, these were the words that kicked off 
my favorite event of the week - eating pizza and watching Star Trek on Friday
nights with my dad and brother. I don't know why some people are attracted to
science, and its associated dreamy holodeck, science fiction, while 
others wonder what all the fuss is about. For me, it was a blend of seeing
compassionate, principled rationalism modeled by a diverse interspecies cast
that included "artificial" life and beings from other planets, and the general
spirit of adventure that infused each episode of the Next Generation arc.

But it was also the introduction to space-time concepts that pepper the entire
Star Trek franchise. Worm holes. Warp speed. Cloaking devices. These fan the
imagination, and plants seeds for a life of subterranan inquiry. 

On such thread for me has been space itself. What constitutes a space? Can 
familiarity with mathematical spaces beyond Euclidean space rendered with 
Cartesian coordinates spur generative imagination?
