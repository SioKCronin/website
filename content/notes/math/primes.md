I began studying primes after seeing how they were used in the RSA public-key
cryptography algorithm. This led me to Euler's totient function and the idea
of relative primes (on integers and on sets of integers, with their parwise
coprime goodness). 

And what would primes be with factoring? Ah, factorization. Why you gotta be
so difficult?

But not so fast factorization, we're building quantum computers and we've got
Shor's algorithm up our sleeves.

So, I think that's the direction I'd like to trace.
