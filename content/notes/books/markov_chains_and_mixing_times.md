Markov Chains and Mixing Times by David Levin, Yuval Peres, and Elizabeth Wilmer.

### Overview

Make no mistake of it, markov chains are the coolest thing ever. That being said, 
I have found my own study of them has developed in fits and starts, as I study
specific applications. I was attracted to this book as it promises to introduces
techniques to calculate the asymptotes geometrically, showing where chains converge
to stationarity. I have known this to be possible for over a year, but I didn't know what
math foundations were needed to approach it (I kept thinking this would best be assessed 
using differential geometry). The book says we're good to go with probability and linear algebra, 
and a certain level of mathematical "maturity" (we'll see if I have that), so 
I think we're good to dive in. 

The key idea that forms the central thread of this book is *mixing time*, which is
the number of steps it takes for a particular chain to converge to the stationary distribution.
From the physics perspective, the material would be *mixed* at this point.
