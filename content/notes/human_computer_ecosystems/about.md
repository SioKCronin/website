I had built a complex meaning-making system that needed to be re-purposed. I 
went hunting for a domain to explore how complex systems develop and evolve over
time. I found possible directions in biology, human dynamics, and physics,
but what really caught my eye was the internet. One of the  most complex system
humans have developed. I wanted to bring my mind to tracking how humans and
computers collaborate. How do they trust one another. How their interactions
are characterized. What is possible for each that is not possible without the other.
I trace this in my work as an Engineering Manager, but have developed a studio
practice of writing, conversing, drawing, and meditating to advance my thinking. 

I disinguish this from HCI because I'm interested in the system of interactions
as its own point of study. I'm motivated professionally because I want to 
steward human computer ecosystems through their development so I can deliver
more value for the companies I care about. That's the feedback loop there. 

I also am just interested in this like following my favorite sports team (uh...
if I watched sports). I want to see how the internet, and the tidal pools of the
internet I help cultivate, fare in the long haul of human development. I'm interested
in what comes next and what came before. I use this interesting to stitch me 
in deeper into my world and into my connections with others. I have a mind
that has a propensity to drift off into abstractions in math and poetics, 
so it's nice to have a research practice that helps me root.

And, perhaps most importantly, at the center of my life is a practice of care
whereby I explore my own becoming while nurturing the becoming of others. The
best way I can see doing that is being honest about my lines of inquiry and passion,
and bringing those in contact with the inquries and passions of others. That's
how we grow together and co-create the worlds we are interesting in inhabiting. 


Are the lifecycles the same? Phasic?
