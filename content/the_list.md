I'm keeping track of companies on a mission to make a meaningful impact in the
world, and the engineering leaders who are building teams within those companies. 
I'm including leadership because ultimately it's people who make companies great, 
and there's no use spending your time giving your all to a great cause if the 
culture is not simultaneously supporting you.

My biggest hope is that all engineers who have the ability to do so will consider 
applying their skills to projects that matter and teams that are healthy, equitable,
and nurturing.

These companies inpsire me. Let me know what companies inspire YOU!
