"The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man, with signs, and
his journeys" - Muriel Rukeyeser

My interest in leveraing technology to cultivate communities of care and healing 
emerges from my own personal origin story. For 35 years, part of me lived frozen 
inside a chronic dissociative disorder that went undetected. After decades of 
yoga and meditation practice, and tons of therapy, in 2016 I emerged in a process 
of healing that changed everthing. 

In the processI saw that we exist as a burgeoning, endlessly forming and deforming 
interconnected fountain of being, and realized that I had learned that in my years
of exile. It turns out that in my search from relief from being buried alive
I had found some windows into a transpersonal identification that not only gave
me great relief then but now serves as an anchor in my present life. We can spin
gold from the ash of our sorrows.

Healing from trauma happens internally as well as systemically. We heal together. 
We are a system of care, and my podcast, This Fountain of Being, is a celebration 
of the power we have to change and cultivate health in our communities.
