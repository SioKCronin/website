"The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man, with signs, and
his journeys" - Muriel Rukeyeser

My interest in leveraing technology to cultivate communities of care and healing 
emerges from a deeply personal origin story. For 25 years I lived frozen inside 
a chronic dissociative disorder that went undetected. It began as a child,
emerging in response to a knowledge of self I could not reconcile with the 
frameworks of knowing presented to me. 

In 2016 I emerged in a process of healing that changed everthing. In the process
I saw that we exist as a burgeoning, endlessly forming and deforming 
interconnected fountain of being. Healing from trauma happens 
internally as well as systemically. We heal together. We are a system of care,
and my podcast, This Fountain of Being, is a celebration of the power we have 
to change and cultivate health in our communities.
