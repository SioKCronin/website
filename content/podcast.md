"The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man, with signs, and
his journeys" - Muriel Rukeyeser

[This Fountain of Being](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-fountain-of-being/id1485854868)

I lead guided meditation sessions based on my ongoing study of non-dualism,
consciousness, bhakti yoga, complex systems, and care. These recordings 
are opportunities to drop in, remember our interconnected nature, find some
stillness and peace, and stoke the fire of care service that emerges when
our core needs are met, including the need to feel deeply loved.
