My studio practice is honing in on practices of marrying embodied practice 
with conceptual scaffolding in service of self and community actualization.
That I am at this point where I believe I can articulate the connections between my 
studio practice (self), network practice (community), and the teams and systems
I serve and aspire to serve (body of professional work) is a product of the 
love and care of my communities. My colleagues, partners, and friends have 
never shamed me for my feral use of metaphors or how I wiggle and check in 
with my body to source networks of knowledge. I am grateful for their belief 
in me and in us.

The focal point of my studio practice is care,
which I experience as a dynamical system of information flow and optimization. 
A network of feedback loops. Coemergent states of becoming. A complex system. 
I'm interested in the network effects of such a system as much
as the development of individual trajectories over time, as I'm observing that 
these network effects greatly shape my network yet I have not always felt equipped to 
track them. As an embodied thinker I can not hold advanced intuitions of multidimensional 
solution spaces accurately in my body, or at least with the fidelity that allows me 
to connect current experiences to specific nodes of knowledge or historical events, 
so I partner with computers. 

A major part of my psycho-social healing as an American who is digging herself 
out of industrialized notions of the autonomous "human unit" is to reclaim my place in the world
as an interconnected being.I am learning to diffuse my 
attention to map broader manifolds of inputs and outputs and network effects
surrounding events that matter most to me in my life. This research is rooted
in a movement practice that blends gaga with my own homebrew 
energetic healing practice and a dialetic practice with indviduals in my network.
I track what I'm learning with sketches, and sit with these sketches while studying 
Bayesian inference, algebraic topology, network theory, platform engineering, and ocean dynamics.

The lineage of research that led to this current studio practice began with
my work with Deborah Hay and continued with Deborah Black and Bryan Campbell 
in NYC through our Experiential Geography research. The research continued
with a host of non-human collaborators and ecosystems through the 
Somatic Natural History Archive. This led to my study of bkakti yoga with 
Jasmine Tarkeshi (2013), which led to my non-dualist "eureka" in 2016. 
I stopped gripping the life raft of my organism as the origin of organizing 
a concept of self and understanding reality, and now I chose to layer networks 
of self identification (holiobiont, chosen family, watershed, etc.). 
To reference style culture, my signature scent
is a layering of multiple scents. 

My desire is to become a poet laureate of complex emergent systems, blending
my growing analytic/critical/technical toolkit alongside the embodied intuitions
and communal practices of care I participate in. That our minds are situated at 
particular 3D vantage points on the waves of 
a multidimensional ocean motivates my enthusiasm for computing. 
My mind's preocupation with my organism prevents me from seeing events 
rising across subsets of the population, which is what I'm intereted in 
addressing to alleviave suffering in systems. I can't sense the 
population, so I collaborate with computing systems. From my perspective, this 
is the core purpose of software engineering. Scan society. Find the wounds. 
Build human-computer systems to gather data, 
intercept information flows, propose new actions based on batch and streaming 
data analysis, and iterate until the "water" runs clean. Machine learning is a 
critical component of this, but for most ventures I'd say is not the bottleneck. 
Exploring how we gather and store high-quality, relevant data in a performant, 
scalable infrastructure, and empower a diverse, creative engineering culture 
to reimagine systems of moving and deriving insights from data to solve problems
that matter is the unsolved question I'm tackling. 

* Gathering data
* Storing data
* Moving data
* Deriving data
* Serving data
* Protecting data

And yet, the technical system is only part of the story. Engineering is a human enterprise.
If we care about finding engigneering solutions, we must care deeply about the human
cultures that foster their emergence. For me, this is rooted both in
nuturing communities of practice as well as supporting the actualization
of indiviudal engineers. As an engineering manager I am brought face to face
with this awesome challenge of tracking the shape of our collective imagination
as a team over time, and running experiments to either speed up our existing 
solution-finding practices or expand the surface area of solutions we perceive
as possible. Mapping our collective neural cloud. This is the arena of engineering
I choose to innovate; the cultivation of thriving human-computer ecoystems. 

I'm interested in nuturting communities of engineering practice that embrace 
what artists have long known to be true - imagination is a portal 
to the powerhouse of the subconcsious. There are rich human cultural traditions 
that challenge and exite the mind-body, leading to innovation. We can dance
the joy of witnessing beauty. We can draw our demons. We can blend our voices
in song and feel our mutual resonance.
Why do keep such pratices so far from engineers? 
Why are offices not set up to prioritize the human body? Why are designers 
the only one's allowed to have creative practice in the engineering ecosystem, 
while engineers are creatively solving problems every day? I will continue to 
dedicate my management practice to addressing these questions, and weaving in 
more and more humanity and creativity into our conception of what it means to build technical systems.

I'm working on a non-linear poem that tracks key
moments of connection across my chosen family, friends, and colleagues. I am 
interested in the information we exchange that bolsters feelings of safety,
creativity, insight, connection, agency, peace, and non-dualist identification.
I am starting by collecting data from WhatsApp voice memos I've shared and 
received; nuggets of care we've exchanged with one another.
