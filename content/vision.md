My studio practice is honing in on practices of marrying embodied practice 
with conceptual scaffolding in service of self and community actualization.
The focal point of my studio practice is care.

I cultivate a well of material from my practices and lived experiences.
I then meet others in the present moment, listen deeply, and draw from my
well in the ways I feel will be of service. And I ask for feedback and track
progress over time, as I track my own. I frame it as art because I believe
in human cultural technology and its trasnmission, and lifestyle and art 
practice as fantastic delivery mechanisms.

Practices right now include:

* gaga (with a Sio twist from previous movement research)
* WhatsApp voice memos
* This Fountain of Being (meditation podcast)
* poetry
* drawing
* engineering management

This lineage of research began with
my work with Deborah Hay and continued with Deborah Black and Bryan Campbell 
in NYC through our Experiential Geography research. The research continued
with a host of non-human collaborators and ecosystems through the 
Somatic Natural History Archive. This led to my study of bkakti yoga with 
Jasmine Tarkeshi (2013), which led to my non-dualist "eureka" in 2016. 
I stopped gripping the life raft of my organism as the origin of organizing 
a concept of self and understanding reality, and now I chose to layer networks 
of self identification (holiobiont, chosen family, watershed, etc.). 
To reference style culture, my signature scent is a layering of multiple scents. 

My desire is to become a poet of complex emergent systems, blending
my growing critical/technical/creative toolkit alongside the embodied intuitions
and communal practices of care I participate in. That our minds are situated at 
particular 3D vantage points on the waves of 
a multidimensional ocean motivates my enthusiasm for computing. 
My mind's preocupation with my organism prevents me from seeing events 
rising across subsets of the population, which is what I'm intereted in 
addressing to alleviave suffering in systems. I can't sense the 
population, so I collaborate with computing systems.

From my perspective, this 
is the core purpose of software engineering. Scan society. Find the wounds. 
Build human-computer systems to gather data, 
intercept information flows, propose new actions based on batch and streaming 
data analysis, and iterate until the "water" runs clean. I see this as 
reiki at the human system level. Machine learning is a critical component, 
but for most ventures I'd say is not the bottleneck. 
Exploring how we gather and store high-quality, relevant data in a performant, 
scalable infrastructure, and empower a diverse, creative engineering culture 
to build systems of moving and deriving insights from data to solve problems
that matter is the unsolved question I'm tackling. I loosely operationalize 
this a practice of platform engineering with the following pillars:

* Gathering data
* Storing data
* Moving data
* Deriving data
* Serving data
* Protecting data

Yet the technical system is only part of the story. Engineering is a human enterprise.
If we care about finding engigneering solutions, we must care deeply about the human
cultures that foster their emergence. For me, this is rooted both in
nuturing communities of practice as well as supporting the actualization
of indiviudal engineers. As an engineering manager I am brought face to face
with this awesome challenge of tracking the shape of our collective imagination
as a team over time, and running experiments to either speed up our existing 
solution-finding practices or expand the surface area of solutions we perceive
as possible. Mapping our collective neural cloud. This is the arena of engineering
in which I choose to innovate.

I'm interested in nuturting communities of engineering practice that embrace 
what artists have long known to be true - imagination is a portal 
to the powerhouse of the subconcsious. The body has a role in ideation. 
There are rich human cultural traditions that challenge and exite the mind-body, 
leading to innovation. We can dance the joy of witnessing beauty. 
We can draw our demons. We can blend our voices in song and feel our mutual resonance.
This is a theme I explore with my partner Carl Tashian, and we are brewing
some programming to suppor this development. 

That I am at this point where I believe I can articulate the connections between my 
studio practice (self), network practice (community), and the teams and systems
I serve and aspire to serve (body of professional work) is a product of the 
love and care of my communities. My colleagues, partners, and friends have 
never shamed me for my feral use of metaphors or how I wiggle and check in 
with my body to source networks of knowledge. I am grateful for their belief 
in me and in us.

I'm working on a non-linear poem that tracks key
moments of connection across my chosen family, friends, and colleagues. I am 
interested in the information we exchange that bolsters feelings of safety,
creativity, insight, connection, agency, peace, and non-dualist identification.
I am starting by collecting data from WhatsApp voice memos I've shared and 
received; nuggets of care we've exchanged with one another.
