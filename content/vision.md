My studio practice is dedicated to care.

I cultivate a garden of experiences, meet others in the present moment, listen deeply,
and offer from my garden in ways we mutually belive might be helpful. I ask for 
feedback and track progress. My garden grows in community. 

My studio practices right now include:

* dance (gaga infused with my historical movement research)
* voice memos
* This Fountain of Being (meditation podcast)
* drawing
* engineering management

This lineage of research began with
my work with Deborah Hay and continued with Deborah Black and Bryan Campbell 
in NYC through our Experiential Geography research. The research continued
with a host of non-human collaborators and ecosystems through the 
Somatic Natural History Archive. This led to my study of bhakti yoga with 
Jasmine Tarkeshi (2013), which led to my non-dualist "eureka" in 2016. 
I stopped gripping the life raft of my organism as the origin for organizing 
a concept of self and understanding reality, and now I chose to layer networks 
of self identifications (holiobiont, chosen family, watershed, etc.),
and navigate through them to build generative systems of care.

My desire is to become a gardener of such systems. That our minds are 
situated at particular 3D vantage points on the waves of 
a multidimensional ocean motivates my enthusiasm for computing. 
My mind's predeliction to prioritize my organism prevents me from seeing events 
rising across subsets of the population, which is what I'm intereted in 
addressing to alleviave suffering in systems. I can't sense the 
population, so I collaborate with computing systems.

From my perspective, this 
is the core purpose of software engineering. Scan society. Find the wounds. 
Build human-computer systems to gather data, 
intercept information flows, propose new actions based on batch and streaming 
data analysis, and iterate until the "water" runs clean. I see this as 
reiki at the human system level. Machine learning is a critical component, 
but for most ventures I'd say is not the bottleneck. 
Exploring how we gather and store high-quality, relevant data in a performant, 
scalable infrastructure, and empower a diverse, creative engineering culture 
to build systems of moving and deriving insights from data to solve problems
that matter is the unsolved question I'm tackling. I loosely operationalize 
this as a practice of platform engineering with the following pillars:

* Gathering data
* Storing data
* Moving data
* Deriving data
* Serving data
* Protecting data

Yet the technical system is only part of the story. Engineering is a human enterprise.
If we care about finding engigneering solutions, we must care deeply about the human
cultures that foster their emergence. For me, this is rooted both in
nuturing communities of practice as well as supporting the personal actualization
of indiviudal engineers. As an engineering manager I track the shape of 
our collective imagination as a team over time, and run experiments to either 
optimize our existing solution-finding practices or expand the surface area of 
solutions we deem possible. A cartographer of our collective neural cloud. This 
is the arena of engineering in which I choose to innovate.

I'm interested in nuturting communities of engineering practice that embrace 
what artists have long known to be true - imagination is a portal 
to the powerhouse of the subconcsious. The body has a role in ideation. 
There are rich human cultural traditions that challenge and exite the mind-body, 
leading to innovation. We can dance the joy of witnessing beauty. 
We can draw our demons. We can blend our voices in song and feel our mutual resonance.
This is a theme I explore with my partner Carl Tashian, and we are brewing
some programming to suppor this development. 

That I am at this point where I believe I can articulate the connections between my 
studio practice (self), network practice (community), and the teams and systems
I serve and aspire to serve (body of professional work) is a product of the 
love and care of my communities. My colleagues, partners, and friends have 
never shamed me for my feral use of metaphors or how I wiggle and check in 
with my body to source networks of knowledge. I am grateful for their belief 
in me and in us.
