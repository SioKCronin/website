# My Deep Reinformcent Learning Journey

## Overview

I'm starting a Reinforcement Learning (RL) journey, and invite you to
join me!

This journey has four interweaving systems of trails:
* approachable overviews (with illustrations) of RL foundations 
* novel RL training environments
* implementations of leading RL methods
* explorations of industry applications

## Foundations

### Intro to Control Theory
### Intro to Deep RL
### RL History
### History of industrial robotics

## RL training environments

### Unity ML Agents
### OpenAI Gym Agents
### OctoHand (novel cephalapod-inspired environment)

## RL methods

### DQN
### DDPG
### PPO
### HER
### HER-PPO

## RL industry applications

### Pick and Sort
### Inventory Management
