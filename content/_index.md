I am a software engineer with a love for machine learning, data engineering, 
and mathematics. I began my career researching early cognitive development at
Harvard University/Harvard Medical School, and then spent several years working 
as a contemoprary dancer and composer, before returning to STEM in 2016. 
I have since contracted at two AI startups, collaborated on open source 
swarm intelligence projects, including SwarmOpt and PySwarms, and was a 2018 
Insight Data Engineering Fellow.

One of the greatest joys in my life has been the cultivation of a 
robust and dynamic intellectual garden that bares the traces of my passions, 
values, ponderings, and dialogues many bright folks. This site is my attempt 
to document my favorite paths through that garden. Drop me a line, and let's nerd out!
