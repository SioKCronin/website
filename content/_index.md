I am a software engineer with a love for machine learning, data engineering,
mathematics and the mind. I began my career researching early cognitive 
development at Harvard University/Harvard Medical School, and then spent several 
years conducting independent embodied cognition research before transitioning to
machine learning research and engineering in 2016. I have since contracted at 
two AI startups, collaborated on open source swarm intelligence projects, 
including SwarmOpt and PySwarms, and was a 2018 Insight Data Engineering Fellow.

One of my life's greatest joys has been the cultivation of a dynamic intellectual 
garden that bares the traces of my passions, values, musings, and 
dialogues with others. This site is my attempt to document some of my favorite 
paths through that garden. Drop me a line, and let's nerd out!
