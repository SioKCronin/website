I am a software engineer with a love for data engineering, evolutionary computing,
and mathematics. I began my career researching early cognitive 
development at Harvard University and the neural substrates of music at Harvard 
Medical School. I then scracthed a creative itch, and worked for several years 
as a contemporary dancer while managing arts organizations. I returned to STEM 
in 2016, and have since contracted at two AI startups (Avisell and Uncountable), 
collaborated on open source swarm intelligence projects (SwarmOpt 
and PySwarms), and was a 2018 Insight Data Engineering Fellow. I am now the Data
Engineering Lead at Landed, where I build data infrastructure to support essential
professionals buy homes in high-cost cities.

One of my life's greatest joys has been the cultivation of a cross-disciplinary
intellectual garden, and this site is my attempt to document some of my favorite 
paths through that garden. Drop me a line, and let's nerd out!
