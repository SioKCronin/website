I am a software engineer with a love for machine learning, robotics, and building intelligent 
pipelines and tools for researchers. I began my career in cognitive neuroscience research, 
and have spent the past two years contracting at startups and collaborating on open 
source ML projects, including SwarmOpt and PySwarms. Here is a smattering of my musings, 
including my math and swarm intelligence notes. Drop me a line, and let's nerd out!
