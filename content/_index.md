I am a software engineer with a love for machine learning, data engineering, and 
building intelligent pipelines and tools for researchers. I began my career in 
cognitive neuroscience research, and have spent the past two years contracting at 
startups and collaborating on open source ML projects. I'm passionate about learning new things, 
and share some of my musings here. Drop me a line, and let's nerd out!
