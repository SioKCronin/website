I am a software engineer with a love for machine learning, data engineering, 
and mathematics. I began my career researching early cognitive development at
Harvard University/Harvard Medical School, and then spent several years working 
as a contemoprary dancer and composer. In 2016 I had an epiphany that led me to 
pure math, software engineering, and humanitarian projects, and have since 
contracted at startups and collaborated on open source 
swarm intelligence projects, including SwarmOpt and PySwarms. 

One of the greatest joys in my life has been the cultivation of a 
robust and dynamic intellectual garden that bares the traces of my passions, 
values, ponderings, and dialogues with so many others. This site is my attempt 
to document my favorite paths through that garden. Drop me a line, and let's nerd out!
