I am a software engineer with a love for machine learning, data engineering, 
and mathematics. I began my career in cognitive neuroscience research, and after several years 
of working as a contemoprary dancer and composer, I had an epiphany that led me to 
pure math, software engineering, and humanitarian projects. I have since 
contracted at startups and collaborated on open source 
swarm intelligence projects, including SwarmOpt and PySwarms. 

One of the greatest joys in my life has been the cultivation of a 
robust and dynamic intellectual garden that bares the traces of my passions, 
values, ponderings, and dialogues with so many others. This site is my attempt 
to document my favorite paths through my garden. Drop me a line, and let's nerd out!
