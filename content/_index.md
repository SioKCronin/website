I am a software engineer and researcher with a love for machine learning, 
data engineering, and building intelligent pipelines and research tools.
I began my career in cognitive neuroscience research, and have spent the past 
two years contracting at startups and collaborating on open source ML projects.

I'm pretty obsessed with swarm optimization, and am working on an open source swarm optimizer ([SwarmOpt](https://github.com/SioKCronin/SwarmOpt)), 
and am also secretly pouring the foundations for a differential geometry proof of the Navier-Stokes 
equations (although, is it still a secret if I tell everyone?). I love learning new 
things and collaborating, so drop me a line, and let's nerd out!
