I am a software engineer with a love for machine learning, data engineering, 
and data experience design. I began my career in cognitive neuroscience research, 
and have spent the past three years contracting at startups and collaborating on 
open source ML projects, including SwarmOpt and PySwarms. Here is a smattering 
of my musings, including my math, engineering, and design notes. Drop me a line, 
and let's nerd out!
