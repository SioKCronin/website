I am a machine learning engineer and researcher whose stomping ground extends from core data engineering to
learning algorithms. I believe we are at our best when dynamically leveraging collective intelligence, and collaborate on projects that reflect that. I began my career in developmental cognitive neuroscience,
and one can always trace an interest in the emergence of mind in complex
systems in my work (whether neural or in a swarm of autonomous particles).
