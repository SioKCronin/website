I am a software engineer and researcher with a love for machine learning and building 
research tools and intelligent data pipelines. I began my career in cognitive neuroscience 
research, and have spent the past two years studying machine learning and data engineering, 
contracting at startups, and collaborating on open source ML projects. Here are my study notes and research musings. I love collaboration, and as of June 1, 2018 am available for hire, so let's connect!
