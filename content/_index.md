I am a machine learning engineer working at the intersection of data engineering,
complexity research, and learning algorithm design. I began my career in cognitive neuroscience, and am attracted to projects exploring emergent patterns of form and movement in complex systems. I am currently conducting independent research with Slow
Research Lab, and on the prowl for my next project.
