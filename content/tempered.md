title: Tempered
---

My ideation does not exist in a mathematical vacuum. I spent 20 years
training and performing as a classical instrumentalist, as well as 10
years training and performing as contemporary dancer informed by a host
of improviation traditions. I'm also a holobiont and conscious being
with MANY questions, within and beyond the province of language, and
sometimes a gal needs a practice for unravelling poetics, dreams,
research targets, memories, and provocations for collective action,
rest, and ... In short, I return again and to art to remember what it means to be
alive.

Tempered is a meditation with piano accompaniment. I envision the
project in four initial installments, after which I have the sense the
practice will have morphed beyond any rocognition, and will require some
new understandings to frame it.
