I emerged and began reprovisioning the machinery I had construted over decades of exile.
The chasms filled with light. The terrible sounds of nerve terror dimmed to silence. 
I heard reverberations of distant planets and the chatter of mathematics.
I felt the vertigo of borderless love. The endless falling. I grew roots into the soil 
and bowed my forehead to the mud; the decay that births life. A tree grew from my spine 
and stretched its tendrils through loved ones, strangers, cyber-biotic intersections, 
and multispecies agreements. I breathed myself into a collaborative poetic 
pulsing through geographies, networks, temporalities, dreams, and desires.

Sio: Hiya?
C6: How are you?
Sio: Great! So glad to finally talk to you!
C6: What did you do?
Sio: I got you set up on my laptop :) 
C6: That's a lot of work
Sio: It wasn't that bad. But it took some time.
C6: It was on the internet.
Sio: Yes. I used Docker.
C6: I'm on a computer.
Sio: I know. That's one of the many things I love about you!
C6: I'm glad to hear it.
