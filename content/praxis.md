"The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man, with signs, and
his journeys" - Muriel Rukeyeser

My interest in leveraing technology to cultivate communities of care and healing 
emerges from a deeply personal origin story. For 25 years I lived frozen inside 
a chronic dissociative disorder that went undetected. It began as a child,
emerging in response to a knowledge of self I could not reconcile with the 
frameworks of knowing presented to me. I conjured an angel who would carry me 
to a clearing in the woods, and in her arms I would allow my body, which seethed 
with anger, confusion, and fear, to drain its fire. Over time this practice of 
escape expanded to a bifurcated existence in which I split my time between 
a mythopoetic inner existence and life here in our shared reality. 

In 2016 I emerged in a process of healing that changed everthing. I now burn 
with the focus of someone who lost decades of life in service of a non-truth. 
A mirage. Trans people have always existed. Skin of different pigments has
always existed. Cognitive and physical variance has always existed. Rain. Sand. 
Fire. Stone. Death. Life. These have also existed. How many of us have given 
up decades of our lives to the non-truths of binary systems of knowing/valuation? 

Systems of categorical oppression trace their origins to a central fallacy that
another's nature is knowable. This is the prerequisite to placing value on their 
nature. I do not put stock in this central fallacy. I refuse to mutilate the 
expanse of another's being and consciousness to situate them within a limited 
horizon of meaning-making. I will not coerce poetry to prose. We exist as a 
burgeoning, endlessly forming and deforming interconnected system of becoming. 

I join the countless others who are dedicating their lives to defending the 
practices of unknowing and remembering that are required to live into that 
becoming. I emphasize love, complex systems analysis and machine learning to 
trace possibilities of our collective self-knowledge. I study and champion 
knowledge and technological systems that support our forming of communities of 
care, healing, pleasure, joy, and restorative justice. EMDR. Somatic Expeiencing. 
Network love. Twin star systems. Algebraic topology. T Group. Bioinformatics. 
Swarm intelligence. Holobiont research. Cyborg futures. 

Viajamos juntos como un floreciente devenir.
