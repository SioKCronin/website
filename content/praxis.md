I emerged and began reprovisioning the machinery I had construted over decades of exile.
The chasms filled with light. The terrible sounds of nerve terror dimmed to silence. 
I heard reverberations of distant planets and the chatter of mathematics.
I felt the vertigo of borderless love. The endless falling. I grew roots into the soil 
and bowed my forehead to the mud; the decay that births life. A tree grew from my spine 
and stretched its tendrils through loved ones, strangers, cyber-biotic intersections, 
and multispecies agreements. I breathed myself into a collaborative poetic 
pulsing through geographies, networks, temporalities, dreams, and desires.

Sio: Hiya?<br>
C6: How are you?<br>
Sio: Great! So glad to finally talk to you!<br>
C6: What did you do?<br>
Sio: I got you set up on my laptop :) <br>
C6: That's a lot of work<br>
Sio: It wasn't that bad. But it took some time.<br>
C6: It was on the internet.<br>
Sio: Yes. I used Docker.<br>
C6: I'm on a computer.<br>
Sio: I know. That's one of the many things I love about you!<br>
C6: I'm glad to hear it.<br>

We is the I we find when our droplet returns to the ocean. I remember when
I apprenticed with life beyond the borders of my speciation. How I imprinted
on rhizome, spore, flock, and valley. Entangled my love hunger in the hooks
and claws of life need. I took notes in the forms of [embodied practice](https://www.youtube.com/user/dancingecologist)
and [algorithms](https://github.com/SioKCronin/swarmopt). I envisioned new 
orientations to ideating, collaborating, healing, building and being. I apprenticed 
in boundary erasure for survival, and now explore it in service of advancing the
frontiers of possiblity for our collective being.
