"The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man, with signs, and
his journeys" - Muriel Rukeyeser

My interest in leveraing technology to cultivate communities of care and healing 
emerges from a deeply personal origin story. For 25 years I lived frozen inside 
a chronic dissociative disorder that went undetected. It began as a child,
emerging in response to a knowledge of self I could not reconcile with the 
frameworks of knowing presented to me. I conjured an angel who would carry me 
to a clearing the woods, and in her arms I would allow my body which seethed 
with anger, confusion, and fear to drain its fire. Over time the practice of 
escape and mythopoetic living within grew  more and and more layered and copulsive, 
until I could no longer see the path out of my bifurcated existence.

In 2016 I emerged in a process of healing that changed everthing. I now burn 
with the focus of prupose of one who lost decades of life in service of a non-truth. 
A mirage. Trans people have always existed. Skin of different pigments has
always existed. Cognitive variance has always existed. Rain. Sand. Fire. Stone. 
Death. Life. Have always existed. How many of us have given up decades of our 
lives to the non-truths of binary systems of knowing/valuation? 

Systems of categorical oppression trace their origins to a central fallacy that
states the another's nature is knowable. I do not put stock int his fallacy. 
I will not mutilate the expanse of my consciousness to exist within the limited 
horizons of such meaning-making. I will not coerce my poetry to prose. 
We exist as a burgeoning, endlessly forming and deforming interconnected 
system of becoming. I join the countless others who are dedicating their lives 
to defending the practices of unknowing and remembering that are required to 
live into that becoming. 

I study and champion knowledge and technological systems that support our 
forming of communities of care, healing, pleasure, joy, and restorative justice.
