# This Fountain of Being

For years I tried to find my way to this illusive "present moment" that all my
spiritual teachers were talking about. I had chronic anxiety and fear stemming
from a queer body that had been targeted by global culture as an axis of shame 
and ridicule. I wanted out. I wanted some relief, and so, like many others,
I tried everything I could think of.

I stared intently at candle flames. I breathed deeply while watching my chest
rise and fall. I saw cloud of thoughts emerge and recede, and named them thoughts.
Yet, despite all my best efforts, I never felt any better.

Meanwhile, in another corner of my life, I was exploring how to relate to the
complex nature of my situated consciousness in the larger fabric of being. 
What does it mean to be embodied? Where dos my body end and other bodies stop?
What does it mean to have agency in such a networked, tethered system?

In 2016 I had a spiritual awakening, initiated by EMDR and Somatic Experiencing,
that changed that course of my life. I found a peace that I never knew as possible,
and it became clear that there are incredibly effective trauma release modalities
that complement the work we do in yoga and meditation. One of the hallmark signs
of someone who has shed their fear and pain skin, is that they change the course
of their lives to serve others. I am no different, and my life is now dedicated 
to exploring ways to create the necessary conditions for others to feel safe, loved, 
witnessed, and free.

My service is three-fold and involves my professional work as an engineer
working financial equity (putting money in the hands of women does a host of 
amazing things for our planet, to mention the lives of those women!), howing up 
and being myself in a variety of spaces to model one small fraction of what trans
people can become if presented with the opportunity to thrive (human existence is 
hard enough without us muddying the water with human-made 
systems of categorical oppression), and guiding others in the cognitive-somatic 
practice that kept me alive all those years in my exile (not offered as a 
substitute for trauma release therapy, but as comfort in the storm). 

I offer daily morning meditations from my practice on WhatsAPP, and you are 
warmly welcomed to join .
