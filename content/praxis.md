"The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man, with signs, and
his journeys" - Muriel Rukeyeser

My interest in leveraing technology to cultivate communities of care and healing 
emerges from a deeply personal origin story. For 25 years I lived frozen inside 
a chronic dissociative disorder that went undetected. It began as a child,
emerging in response to a knowledge of self I could not reconcile with the 
frameworks of knowing presented to me. 

In 2016 I emerged in a process of healing that changed everthing. Systems of 
categorical oppression trace their origins to a central fallacy that
another's nature is knowable. This is the prerequisite to placing value on their 
nature. I do not put stock in this central fallacy. I refuse to mutilate the 
expanse of another's being and consciousness to situate them within a limited 
horizon of meaning-making. I will not coerce poetry to prose. We exist as a 
burgeoning, endlessly forming and deforming interconnected system of becoming. 

I join the countless others who are dedicating their lives to defending the 
practices of unknowing and remembering that are required to live into that 
becoming. I emphasize love, complex systems analysis and machine learning to 
trace possibilities of our collective self-knowledge. I study and champion 
knowledge and technological systems that support our forming of communities of 
care, healing, love, pleasure, joy, and restorative justice. EMDR.
