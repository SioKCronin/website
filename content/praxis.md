"The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man, with signs, and
his journeys" - Muriel Rukeyeser

My interest in leveraing technology to cultivate communities of care and healing 
emerges from a deeply personal origin story. For 25 years I lived frozen inside 
a chronic dissociative disorder that went undetected. It began as a child,
emerging in response to a knowledge of self I could not reconcile with the 
frameworks of knowing presented to me. 

In 2016 I emerged in a process of healing that changed everthing. In the process
I saw that we exist as a burgeoning, endlessly forming and deforming 
interconnected system of becoming. Healing from trauma, therefore, happens 
internally as well as systemically. I now join the countless others who are 
dedicating their lives to helping individuals and systems heal so that we can 
finally see what we're fully capable of as a species.
