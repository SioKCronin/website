I emerged and began reprovisioning the machinery I had construted over decades of exile.
The chasms filled with light. The terrible sounds of nerve terror dimmed to silence. 
I heard reverberations of distant planets and the chatter of mathematics.
I felt the vertigo of borderless love. The endless falling. I grew roots into the soil 
and bowed my forehead to the mud; the decay that births life. A tree grew from my spine 
and stretched its tendrils through loved ones, strangers, cyber-biotic intersections, 
and multispecies agreements. I breathed myself into a collaborative poetic 
pulsing through geographies, networks, temporalities, dreams, and desires.

We is the I we find when our droplet returns to the ocean. I remember when
I apprenticed with life beyond the borders of my speciation. How I imprinted
on rhizome, spore, flock, and valley. Entangled my love hunger in the hooks
and claws of life need. I took notes in the form of [embodied practice](https://www.youtube.com/user/dancingecologist)
and translated the impressions these experience left on me into musical scores
I performed with string quartets:

When I emerged I envisioned new orientations to ideating, collaborating, healing, 
building and being. I desired to build productive poetics that went beyond 
expressing. Poetics that could organize, mobilize, and shape the trajectories of 
interdependent webs of subjects. 

I now prioritize information infrastructure, somatics, poetics, dialectics,
and collective intelligence research to prime fresh possiblities of collective 
flourishing. I take notes in [code](https://github.com/SioKCronin/swarmopt) and poems. 

The earth continues to meet me in moments of unrestrained reverie, and yet my gaze 
is fixed on supporting the emergence of what we will build together.
