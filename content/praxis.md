I emerged and began reprovisioning the machinery I had construted over decades of exile.
The chasms filled with light. The terrible sounds of nerve terror dimmed to silence. 
I heard reverberations of distant planets and the chatter of mathematics.
I felt the vertigo of borderless love. The endless falling. I grew roots into the soil 
and bowed my forehead to the mud; the decay that births life. A tree grew from my spine 
and stretched its tendrils through loved ones, strangers, cyber-biotic intersections, 
and multispecies agreements. I breathed myself into a collaborative poetic 
pulsing through geographies, networks, temporalities, dreams, and desires.

We is the I we find when our droplet returns to the ocean. I remember when
I apprenticed with life beyond the borders of my speciation. How I imprinted
on rhizome, spore, flock, and valley. Entangled my love hunger in the hooks
and claws of life need. I took notes in the form of [embodied practice](https://www.youtube.com/user/dancingecologist)
and translated the impressions these experience left on me into musical scores
I performed with string quartets:

When I emerged I envisioned new orientations to ideating, collaborating, healing, 
building and being. I desired to build productive poetics that went beyond 
expressing. Poetics that could organize, mobilize, and shape the trajectories of 
interdependent webs of subjects. For so long I had apprenticed in boundary 
erasure for survival. I had studied and taught nondualism in the Vedic tradition. 
I had primed the canvas for an identification of self that pressed beyond the borders of organism. 

I prioritize engineering, movement research, poetics, and collective intelligence 
praxis to prime fresh possiblities of collective flourishing. I take notes 
in [code](https://github.com/SioKCronin/swarmopt) and poems. I apprentice
as a steward of growing complex data systems to provide scaffolding to my inquiry. 
The earth still meets me in moments of unrestrained reverie. I dance my understandings. 
I feel musical scores of energetic response. And yet ... my gaze stays fixed on supporting
that which we are build together.
