I lead guided meditation sessions based on my ongoing study of bhakti yoga, 
complex systems, and care. When offered in person I weave in movement, sound,
and reiki. These offerings are opportunities to drop in, remember our 
interconnected nature, find some stillness and peace, and stoke the fire of 
care and service that emerges when our core needs are met, including the 
need to feel deeply seen and loved.

I mentor women entering tech, as they bring their energy, vision, and 
intelligence to solve problems that matter in the field.
