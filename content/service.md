[Maitri](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfdCBSPKmDcm0hM4rX2uvZQ)

Loving kindness exists at the center for thriving communities. My work
is dedicated to stoking and maintaining unconditional positive self
regard and extending this to broader and broader concentric rings
of affinity networks.

Guided meditation sessions based on ongoing study of bhakti yoga, 
nature, and care. These offerings are opportunities to drop in, 
remember our interconnected nature, find some stillness and peace, 
and stoke the fire of care and service that emerges when our core needs 
are met, including the need to feel deeply seen and loved.

I mentor women entering tech, as they bring their energy, vision, and 
intelligence to solve problems that matter in the field.
