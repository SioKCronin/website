Building out a daily practice. Drawing inspiration from my teachers.
Alvin Collantes. Bobbi Jene Smith. Deborah Hay. The countless friends
I met in the Somatic Natural History Archive. My ongoing dialogues
with Zubair Ahmed, Deborah Black, Carolyn Strauss, and Maria Blaisse. 
The love I feel for Moosa and Carl, and their ever-unfolding networks of 
care and connection to others. The pleasure I get from color, sensation,
movement, tension and release. The abstraction of the chakra system
as a set of lenses to prioritize grounding, creativity, purpose, connection,
power, understanding, and broader identification. 

I prioritized cognitive development since my awakening because it was so 
thrilling to see how fast my mind could grow new tendrils. I emphasized
the acquisition of new knowledge. My body went along for the ride. It is
asking now for deeper integration with my research on the fuller sensorium,
not to throw the cognitive development off-track, but to fill the shapes I've 
inscribed with color and texture. The mural I've begun is a great footnote.
How I delighted in drawing the gestures of my mind-body, yet how I did not
feel called to color them in. How deeply my thirst was for expansion after 
so many years of limiting my mind-body gestures. 

When I center my practice on joy, pleasure, delight, and centered-power, my
entire being springs to life. When I watch my footage I can see when I'm 
drawing mind gestures, and when I'm reaching for more pleasure. Situating
myself in pleasure and spinning it out, like taking a ball of dough and rolling
it out so that it encompasses more and more space. I laugh a lot when I find it.
Right there in the center of it all, my own ability to really feel pleasure
and allow it to expand without judgements. Am I supposed to be doing this? Is
this too much? Is this ethical, given the suffering of all beings? The vitality
of the mind-body when it is centered in it's own centered love of self points 
to the answer. The mind-body tuned to its own ever-evolving lived understanding 
of love is the mind-body most capable of bringing true resource to others who
are suffering. When I am in that state, I don't need anyone to absolve my suffering
for me. No long phone calls with friends. No impossible demands of partners. I
feed myself from the inside with my own energy. I reverse the hydraulics, shifting
from a need machine to a fountain. 

I'm interested in site reliability engineering. In the formalism
of setting and maintaining expectations across human-technical systems. The
expecations we set with one another. How we maintian them. This runs through
my interest in networking protocols. These core contracts that are the atoms
of our living breathing internet. I'm interested in those that examining how
changing these fundamentals would change the resonance of the entire system. 
I latched on to compute initially, with quantum computing, but have shifted my
attention to the barriers between systems. If the internet is an organism, 
I'm interested in cell membranes and the circulatory system more broadly.

I'm reimagining my studio, drawing inspiration from Maria Blaisse and a smattering
of traditional martial arts dojos. Where the existence of the human being is
centered, not the desk and chair. I'm interested in a desk that conforms to my
body posture, not the other way around. Yoga asana and pillows become "chair"
in this context, with an emphasis on the moving body. Yesterday I sat in a meeting
where my pelvis was free to stretch while taking notes. It felt radical and
liberating to be meeting the needs of my body while meeting the needs of my mind.
Sound. Smell. Shifting light throughout the day. The beauty of objects from loved
ones surrounding me. Capitalizing on the opportunity of a home office. How much
humanity can flow through my day. I think I've been performing what I think 
a good student engineering manager does. Reading Hacker News while running on a 
treadmill, or something. But I got into this field to do this very integration.
I spent decades creating pathways to my subconscious powerhouse via the formalism
of art practice. Training in enough technique to allow ideas to ripple through,
but relying on the deep intuition of the mind-body to do the heavy lifting of
ideation. I believed this could be applied to engineering, and took heart in 
the senior engineering practices I witnessed in Carl. I don't have to wonder if
this is a fruitful path. I live with someone who exhibits the benefits of 
investing in slow mind over decades. A rich intellectual garden, that is growing
richer with his investment in somatics. 

I'm curious to see what I can explore this week, and how this practice will shift
while in retreat next week.
