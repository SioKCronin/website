# Four

{{<youtube qcNBTKzccXw>}}

Today I explored what it means to come from somewhere with Alvin Collantes. 

Our roots. Our ancestors. Soil. Fiber. The basin
at the bottom of it all that holds the ocean.  

I took the  practice out into the world. 
Pressing the earth with my thighs. Proclaiming myself as its progency
Tracking my relationship to our molten core. 

I made my way to a park where I saw a man throw a boomerang. From my 
vantage point it looked, at first, as though the boomerang would 
track the path of a frisbie. Gliding directly away from 
the man. But then, all of a sudden, it turned back sharply. I watched
him throw it three times. He never caught it, nor did he
attempt to. Like me, he seemed fascinated by 
the mechanics of the elipses this 90 degree angle spinning disk inscribed.

I continued along the path and took a self portrait. 
A portrait of my mind as an instrument of meaning-making. It was 
such a thrill to see myself. How my body-mind, living
in perception and the hunt for beauty, corporeal extension, desire
fullfillment can play with my concept-mind, the assigner of value. 
When they get humming I can create a state of creative reverie where 
I deem everything I see as incredibly valuable. Every shadow. 
Every geometric patterning. Every convergence of sets of pasts 
meeting sets of possible futures. I learned this when I was young 
as a form of freeing myself from the very particular story line of 
my life as a buried transgirl
trying to either extricate herself from her existential condition
or find a way to safely live. 

In the self portrait I see how I am saying to myself, "if you drop 
the tilted topgraphy as being 'wrong', can you center the geometry 
of a fence and its shadow as figure, accept its centrality in
the image, and just enjoy it?" I ask myself to
play with believing in a new potential orientation long
enough to rest in it and see what it has to offer. 

And it dawned on me my own unique situation, as a transwoman who trained
in both emobidiment (informally through an extended period of self-documentation
and formally through dance) as well as science, math and engineering. How
statistically rare those domains colliding in one person are. My trans 
nature, with its rich lineage of forging an 
indepdent practice of mind to undersand and document an existence in 
a social vacuum. My movement practice, born of a desire to control my body
and thereby escape it, yet now has been repurposed to create the 
opportunity for a deeply embodied experience of living. And then my 
conceptual abstraction practices in engineering which now call me 
to connect my embodied creativity to my technical formalism. 
What a delightful confluence of lineages. 

I started today feeling nervous about whether I would find a practice
I could bring back home with me, but here I am finding it on day 1, no 
small part due to Alvin's deep inner wisdom and guidance. I belong here.
On the planet. In my body. And in my unique practice of meaning-making
that was born of so much inpsiration, struggle and hope.

I slowed my groove down, to see if I could find sustainable rest. I am learning
about self care and self harm. A friend of mine lashed out at me recently,
and in my reflections I realized they are equally lashing out to themselves. I 
compare this to my partners, who each are very kind to themselves, and are
therefore practiced in being kind. Self care as training ground for showing
up with more compassion in the world. In this body this looks like amping
up the tracking of pleasure. The reflection of sun off the vines outside my 
window. The soft air my body moves through. The safety of this home.

My ideation feels pensive this morning. I am coming back to my studio practice
after such a long hiataus. 

# Two

Went on a walk looking for beauty, and perhaps to learn something about what I 
chose to see in the world around me. I find myself drawn to images that ask me
to consider a new framework of seeing. Trees that become friendly beasts. 
Wire lines inscribing some seemingly relevant geometric proof. An improbable
shadow requiring me to wonder how I see in my mind's eye the presence of those
I love. 

Tonight I blended Alvin's practice with my own geoflora tracing practice
and a little Deborah Hay, mostly in my percussive use of my feet, which
reminds me of the floor shuffling in The Runner. I'm struck by Alvin's committment
to spinnging out kinetic potential from deep within, and the continuousness of
the practice. An embrace of repetition.

# One

Building out a daily practice. Drawing inspiration from my teachers.
[Alvin Collantes](https://www.alvincollantes.com/), [Bobbi Jene Smith](https://www.gagapeople.com/en/teachers/bobbi-jene-smith/),
[Deborah Hay](https://dhdcblog.blogspot.com/). The countless friends
I met in the [Somatic Natural History Archive](https://www.youtube.com/user/dancingecologist/videos). My ongoing dialogues
with Zubair Ahmed, Deborah Black, Carolyn Strauss, and Maria Blaisse. 
The love I feel for Moosa and Carl, and their ever-unfolding networks of 
care and connection to others. The pleasure I get from color, sensation,
movement, tension and release.

I prioritized cognitive development since my awakening because it was so 
thrilling to see how fast my mind could grow new tendrils. I emphasized
the acquisition of new knowledge. My body went along for the ride. It is
asking now for deeper integration with my research on the fuller sensorium,
not to throw the cognitive development off-track, but to fill the shapes I've 
inscribed with color and texture. The mural I've begun is a great footnote.
How I delighted in drawing the gestures of my mind-body, yet how I did not
feel called to color them in. How deeply my thirst was for expansion after 
so many years of limiting my mind-body gestures. 

When I center my practice on joy, pleasure, delight, and centered-power, my
entire being springs to life. When I watch my footage I can see when I'm 
drawing mind gestures, versus reaching for more pleasure. Situating
myself in pleasure and spinning it out, like taking a ball of dough and rolling
it out so that it encompasses more and more space. I laugh a lot when I find it.
Right there in the center of it all, my own ability to really feel pleasure
and allow it to expand without judgements. Am I supposed to be doing this? Is
this too much? Is this ethical, given the suffering of all beings? The vitality
of the mind-body when it is centered in it's own love of self points 
to the answer. The mind-body tuned to its own ever-evolving lived understanding 
of love is the mind-body most capable of bringing true resource to others who
are suffering. When I am in that state, I don't need anyone to absolve my suffering
for me. No long phone calls with friends. No impossible demands of partners. I
feed myself from the inside with my own energy. I reverse the hydraulics, shifting
from a need machine to a fountain of care. 

Today's practice reminded me why I'm interested in site reliability engineering. 
In the formalism of setting and maintaining expectations across 
human-technical systems. The expecations we set with one another. 
How we maintian them. This runs through my interest in networking protocols. 
These core contracts that are the atoms of our living breathing internet. 
I'm interested in those who are examining how
changing these fundamentals would change the resonance of the entire system. 
I latched on to compute initially, with quantum computing, but have shifted my
attention to the barriers between systems. If the internet is an organism, 
I'm interested in cell membranes and the circulatory system more broadly.

I'm reimagining my studio, drawing inspiration from Maria Blaisse and a smattering
of memories I hold in my body of martial arts dojos and dance studios I've
trained in. Where the potential of the human being is
centered, not the desk and chair. I'm interested in a desk that conforms to my
body posture, not the other way around. Yoga asana and pillows become "chair"
in this context, with an emphasis on the kinetic body that is always in motion,
event at "rest". Yesterday I sat in a meeting
where my pelvis was free to stretch while taking notes. It felt radical and
liberating to be meeting the needs of my body while meeting the needs of my mind.

Sound. Smell. Shifting light throughout the day. The beauty of objects from loved
ones surrounding me. Capitalizing on the opportunity of a home office. How much
humanity can flow through my day. I think I've been performing what I think 
a good student engineering manager does. Reading Hacker News while running on a 
treadmill, or something like that. But I got into this field to do this very integration.
I spent decades creating pathways to my subconscious powerhouse via the formalism
of art practice. I trained to allow ideas to ripple through,
relying on the deep intuition of the mind-body to do the heavy lifting of
ideation. I believed this could be applied to engineering, and took heart in 
the senior engineering practices I witnessed in my partner Carl, whose studio
practice is a priviledge to witness up close. I don't have to wonder if
I'm on the right path. I live with 
someone who exhibits the benefits of investing in slow mind over decades 
and applying it simultaneously to art and engineering. The art of engineering.

I'm curious to see what I can explore this week, and how this practice will shift
while in retreat next week. I'm brining some ML papers (the one about an infinitely
wide neural network, I mean, come on that's a cool horizon to imagine), a book 
on abstract algebra and a book on algebraic topology (still determined to 
stitch topology into my imagination), a wheelbarrow full of 
self-care products (amassed after watching too many of Vogue's self-care videos), 
clothes to move in, a bodyboard and wetsuit, my camera and poloroid print, 
a big sketchbook and pencils, some candles. And what do I hope the alchemy
of these materials will deliver? Nothing in particular. I hope they serve
as prompts, as scaffolding, as companions as I wander into the unknown of my 
imagination. It's been four years, and I'm ready to reconnect with the progress 
I've made, and where my feels are pointing me.
