# Oloid

The oloid is the symbol for my studio practice where I blend
my artistic practice with my engineering practice, as well as the symbol for 
how I love. In my studio practice I ingegrate my conscious mind with my embodied intelligence. 
I do this formerly in both spheres with study and practice. And informally through the delight of 
my own integrated mind which I taste as I move around the world, draw, write poetry,
dance, and engage in conversation. The ocean of my imagination
is spherical, and I rest my attention at the center so I can move equally
between sensation and concept. This is not easy task in a business world where
sensation is so ruthlessly cut-out of the praxis of working, so I dedicate to 
this practice with the ferocity of a nun who knows what she stands
to lose if the fullness of their being is once again denied. 

This is me proclaiming myself. After four
years of working in tech I found I was still holding my breath.
I began dulling my body, not sure how to bring it's perspective to bare
on the abstractions I was interactin with. I shut down decades of channel making 
between my conscioussness and subconscious via my embodied intelligence. For example,
what are you referencing when you check your gut before making a decision? 
I spent years developing an inner vocabulary for having such conversations. I did
so as a form of survival, but now direct this conversations towards desire, curisoity,
and joy.

I find I am most at rest when I see events as existing a the intersection
of a cresting wave of matter and time, but not in themselves worthy of all of
our focus. I prefer a diffuse holding of identification. I rest somewhere around 
the present moment and present material situation, but with a soft grip. I stay
positioned on the wave so I can move about. This is how I think, and rather than 
try to un-think this way, I gravitate towards disciplines that benefit from 
such modes of thinking. This is waht led me to human-computer ecosystems. 
The situated nature of my our own minds blinds to signal about our world, 
even our own minds. Quantified self, extended mind, and empathetic tech
seemed obvious extensions of a homo sapiens sapiens. As obvious as penicillin 
in the care of the self and species. Trace the ripples of our motion to model 
trajectories and propose helpful nudges to deliver new possible futures. 

That's how it seemed to me four years ago,
and now, it feels even more clearly the purpose of software engineering, when
applied to problems that matter. Also, perhaps given the age I've begun my 
formal engineering training in, I see machine learning as a part of a "full-stack"
platform engineering system. I also hold information as the first class citizen, 
with all other aspects of the system serving it. 

* Gathering data
* Storing data
* Moving data
* Enriching data
* Serving data
* Protecting data

This is what guides my on-going research on engineering systems. But that is only
part of the story. Engineering systems exist as human-computer ecosystems.
So, if we care about engigneering solutions, we must care deeply about the human
cultures that steward such engineering solutions into existence. For me, this 
is rooted both in practice of nuturing the community as well as encouraging
deep personal development; studio practices for every player where they 
are encouraged to cultivate their own unique art of engineering. I will speak
of both things here, but MBAs be warned, I don't speak the language of capitalism.
The culture that births powerful human-computer ecosystems also exists beyond
capitalism at the very fiber of complex social organization (think ants, honeybees,
adversarial AIs, etc.). My ideation springs from these deeper wells, although
my experience shows such creative upswells play nicely with startups, provided
they are situated to honor creativity and humanity, which is what I've 
experienced at Landed. 

I'm chosing to blog about this because bringing my full mind-body to the table
is why I got in tech. For whatever reason, I felt I had to prove myself first
in the formalism of the craft before proposing my personal take. I think this
was prudent, and I will forver study to increase the bandwidth between my
idiosyncratic imagination and colleagues (because networks are where it's at!).
