The ocean of my imagination is spherical, and I rest my attention at the center so I can move equally
between sensation and concept. This is not easy task in a business world where
sensation is so ruthlessly cut-out of the praxis of working, so I dedicate to 
this practice with the ferocity of a nun who knows what she stands
to lose if the fullness of their being is once again denied. This is me 
proclaiming myself. After four years of working in tech I found I was still 
holding my breath. 
I began dulling my body, not sure how to bring it's perspective to bare
on the canonical way of framing engineering's abstractions. Where others
saw opportunities to "architect" I saw the opportunity to "garden". I simply
do not see the abstractions of human-computer engineering systems as needing
to stay anchored on the mechanical/material foundations of the system. An
evolving codebase, and the human culture making it, is a complex system. I 
prefer to leverage the abstractions and research from other complex systems.

In particular, I find I am most at rest when I see events as existing as the instantaneous
snapshot of a cresting wave of matter and time that has developed in response
to uncountable other events. I prefer a diffuse holding of identification
with the present moment so that I can trace the vectors implying the events,
and follow them through the to the possible futures they imply. This approach
to life, machine learning, and engineering is a product of meditation, a practice
I learned as a child in response to traumatic events, and my study of Bayesian
inference, which just gets you thinking about time differently. I prefer 
to situate myself on waves so that I might move about them. 

This is how I think, and rather than try to un-think this way, I gravitate 
towards disciplines that benefit from 
such modes of thinking. This is what led me to wanting to steward 
human-computer systems. Such systems are oceans, which are themselves systems.
My current studio practice blends daily movement meditation with an ongoing
study of waves (bodysurfing and kinetic sketching), and a meandering study of 
algebraic topology, learning algorithms, and emergence in complex systems. 
My goal is to become a wave whisperer for complex emergent systems, blending
my growing analytic/critical toolkit alongside embodied intuition. My 
professional domain is human-computer systems leveraging machine learning
to solve problems that matter. My embodiment teacher is the ocean, Gaga for people,
and my meditation practice. 

That our minds are situated at particular vantage points on the waves of 
matter and time blinds us signal coming from other parts of the wave.
Quantified self, extended mind, and empathetic tech
are obvious propoals for how we can gather and trust data beyond our sensorium. 
I see this development as obvious as penicillin in the care of the self and species. 
Trace the ripples on the waves to model 
trajectories and propose helpful nudges to deliver new possible futures. 

This feels more and more clearly to me the purpose of software engineering, when
applied to problems that matter. Find the friction, the wound, and build a 
human-computer system to gather data, intercept work/experience flows, propose
new actions based on predictive analysis of the futures the data suggests,
and iterate until the "water" runs clean. 

I see machine learning as a part of a "full-stack"
platform engineering system. I also hold information as the first class citizen, 
with all other aspects of the system serving it. 

* Gathering data
* Storing data
* Moving data
* Enriching data
* Serving data
* Protecting data

This is what guides my on-going research on engineering systems. But that is only
part of the story. Engineering systems exist as human-computer ecosystems.
So, if we care about engigneering solutions, we must care deeply about the human
cultures that steward such engineering solutions into existence. For me, this 
is rooted both in practice of nuturing the community as well as encouraging
deep personal development; studio practices for every player where they 
are encouraged to cultivate their own unique art of engineering. I will speak
of both things here, but MBAs be warned, I don't speak the language of capitalism.
The culture that births powerful human-computer ecosystems also exists beyond
capitalism at the very fiber of complex social organization (think ants, honeybees,
adversarial AIs, etc.). My ideation springs from these deeper wells, although
my experience shows such creative upswells play nicely with startups, provided
they are situated to honor creativity and humanity, which is what I've 
experienced at Landed. 

I'm chosing to blog about this because bringing my full mind-body to the table
is why I got in tech. For whatever reason, I felt I had to prove myself first
in the formalism of the craft before proposing my personal take. I think this
was prudent, and I will forver study to increase the bandwidth between my
idiosyncratic imagination and colleagues (because networks are where it's at!).
