Siobhán is a data engineer with a passion for 
scalable infrastructure, machine learning and interactive intelligence.

She began her career researching how humans learn at Harvard's Lab for
Developmental Studies and Harvard Medical School, and now develops tools
to help machines and humans collaborate together. She is the Data Engineering Lead 
at Landed, where she helps support the financial well-being of essential professionals.

Siobhán has published research in Brain & Cognition, Neuroreport, and
Model View Culture, and presented at the Conference on Complex Systems,
Conference on Cognitive Neuroscience, AlterConf, PyLadies, Metis, and
Temple University. She is the lead developer of SwarmOpt (an open-source swarm 
intelligence algorithm library), a member of Bay Area Women in Machine Learning
and Data Science, and a guest researcher at Slow Research Lab.

After decades of chronic anxiety stemming from the violence directed towards queer people, 
Siobhán experienced a life-changing EMDR/Somatic Experiencing process in 2016 that 
resulted in a profound shift in her consciousness. Her life is now dedicated to 
creating the conditions for others to emerge from and dismantle systems of systemic oppression.
